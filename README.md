# FiftyvilleDNP

This project is a practice in LINQ, and a theft mystery you must solve.
Included in the project is a fiftyville.db sqlite file with all the data.
The intention is that you write LINQ queries in the Programme.cs class, and use the PrettyPrint method to output a query result as a table in the console.

You will have to go to the DataAccess/FiftyVilleContext.cs class and change the Data Source path to point to the fiftville.db file in your project, when you have it checked out.

# Description:

A rubber duck was stolen from Fiftyville.

The town of Fiftyville wants you to solve the mystery of the stolen duck.
Authorities believe that the theif/thieves stole the duck and then, shortly afterwards, took a flight out of town, with the help of an accomplice. 
Your goal is to identify:

1) Who the thief is,
2) What city the thief escaped to,
3) Who the thief's accomplice is who helped them escape

All you know is that 
- The theft took place on July 28.
- Took place on Chamberlin Street

Come up with a list of suspects. Can you narrow it down to 8? How much further down can you narrow your suspects?
